# Setup Instructions
This app requires Firefox browser and python. You can find the link <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"> here</a>
<br> There are also some python dependencies you must intall: 
<br> 1. Install <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html"> PIP</a> Python package manager 
<br>  You can do this by executing the get-pip.py for windows, or homebrew/macports for Mac. I personally recommend Homebrew.
